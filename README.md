# 🧠 OOP Mastery in Java

Welcome to **OOP-Mastery**, a collection of Java programs designed to help you understand and practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** from basics to advanced concepts.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project covers practical, real-world **OOP Scenarios** that demonstrate key principles like:

- ✅ Classes and Objects  
- ✅ Attributes, Methods, and Constructors  
- ✅ Access Modifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`)  
- ✅ Encapsulation (Getters and Setters)  
- ✅ Inheritance and `super` keyword  
- ✅ Polymorphism and Method Overriding  
- ✅ Abstract Classes and Interfaces  
- ✅ Inner, Static, and Anonymous Classes  
- ✅ Enums and Constants  
- ✅ Static and Final modifiers  
- ✅ User Input with `Scanner`  
- ✅ Working with Dates
